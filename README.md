## What is the project about?  
This project aims to explore a dataset collected by The City of Vancouver's Open Data Portal on trees in Vancouver. It is part of the larger _datateachr_ package developed by Hayley Boyce and Jordan Bourak. The goal of this project is to practice data wrangling, presenting manipulated data using appropriate graphics, and reporting the analysis in a reproducible R Markdown file.
